# SassDoc theme boilerplate

So you want to build your own theme? You've come to the appropriate place. This is a blank theme so you can build yours based on this one, without too much hassle hopefully.

This theme has no CSS, no JavaScript and barely displays any information at all. All it has is a working view that explains how you should proceed to output content about your documented items.

Note that this theme uses:

* [Themeleon](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon) as a theming engine (but you could do without)
* [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/) as a template engine, through [Themeleon-swig](https://github.com/themeleon/themeleon-swig) (but you could do without)
